There are line segments identified by their endpoints.

Part 1:
Considering horizontal and vertical lines.
Find the number of points where two lines overlap.

This looks like a line intersection problem.
There are formulas for this, but it might be easier to do an algorithmic approach.
Most of the efficient algorithms are "sweep line" style.

hmatrix, hgeometry

1. order points by X-coord
2. Gather horizontal and vertical lines
    a. Sweep from left to right on the X axis
    b. Events
        - New line segment
            - Remember y position
            - overlap
                - continue to end of overlap, skipping other lines
                - count distance
        - intersection
            - count

Alternate approach
- Decompose line segments into grid points. Find all instances of multiple grid points.
