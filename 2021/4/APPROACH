There are a random sequence of numbers, and some number of subsequences all the same length.
We must find the permutation of the subsequence that ends earliest in the random sequence.

1. Turn the random sequence inside out. O(n), n is length of random sequence
E.g. [3,1,4,2,5,0] would become an array whose values are the original index, [5,1,3,0,2,4]

2. Iterate through the subsequences. O(m), m is the total length of all subsequences
    a. Using the numbers as indexes into the inside-out array, find the greatest value in the array. This is the score of the subsequence.

3. The subsequence with the lowest score is the winner.

O(n+m)

Scoring:

1. Construct a sparse array of the board. The array indexes are the numbers on the board, and the values are equal to the index if the number is on the board. E.g. [0,1,2,0,4,5]. O(n), n is size of board.
2. Iterate backwards through the random sequence starting at the subsequence score. O(m) m is length of random sequence
    a. Set the index corresponding to that number to 0 in the board array.
3. Sum the sparse array. O(n), n is size of board.

O(n+m)

Part 2
Same as part 1, except step 3 is inverted to be the greatest score.
