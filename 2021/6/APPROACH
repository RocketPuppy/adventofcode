Part 1:

Creates a new fish every 7 days.
The new fish creates a new fish after 9 days.

x(t) = x0 * 2^(t/7)
x(80) = 5 * 2^(80/7)

^^^ Keep track of total fish in a day slot and then we scale with iterations, not fish
^^^ This is the way to do it

sum(fish') = sum(fish) - (n - f) + f*14
n = total fish
f = fish spawning
f = 0,1, 1, 1,1, 2,1,1, 3,2,1,1, 4,5,3,1,1, 5,9,7
